      <description>Another week has passed and as I promised last week, I am going to post interesting JavaFX Links here again. I specially want to thank Jonathan Giles, Richard Bair and Jasper Potts for their work in collecting the JavaFX Links of the week. Yet I cannot contribute much to the links of the week but hopefully in the future this will change.
Here are the JavaFX Links of the Week 2, February 2010:</description>

      <description>Today I decided to post regularly interesting JavaFX links of the past week. Thanks to Jonathan Giles for his great posts on &amp;#8220;Java Desktop Links of the Week&amp;#8221;. The JavaFX links are just taken from Jonathan&amp;#8217;s posts in order to build a little JavaFX news archieve on my own blog and to inform my subscribers on interesting JavaFX news.

      <description>For everybody who likes to learn the Java programming language or who is forced to learn Java I have found a great online tutorial teaching you the essence of Java programming. Specially students should pay attention to this course as it gives a really good introduction to the Java programming language.
The online course can be found here.
Enjoy learning Java and afterwards take a look at JavaFX.</description>
