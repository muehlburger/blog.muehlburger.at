      <description>SMOB is a prototype developed to enable semantic microblogging. It can be seen as Twitter enriched with semantic data.

John Breslin writes in his blog post:
 The prototype uses FOAF and SIOC to model microbloggers, their properties, account and service information, and the microblog updates that users create. A multitude of publishing services can ping one or a set of aggregating servers as selected by each user, and it is important to note that users retain control of their own data through self hosting.</description>
