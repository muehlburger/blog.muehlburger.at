      <description>Grabeeter (@grabeeter) has just been launched and I think it is a very useful tool.
Grabeeter enables you to grab your tweets which means that you are able to store your tweets on your local harddrive in a structured format (xml at the time). Using the Grabeeter Client you are also able to perform searches on your local stored tweets.
This solves in parts the following problem. Maybe some of you have already noticed that if you have written more than 3200 Tweets you are not able to access your first tweets anymore due to Twitter access restrictions.</description>

      <description>Related articles by Zemanta {.zemanta-related-title}        On a six-minute interview on stage with TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg states that if he&amp;#8217;d start facebook again all privacy settings by DEFAULT would be PUBLIC. A very interesting approach which leads to the question if people want if all of their data is available publicly?</description>
