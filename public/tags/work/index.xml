      <description>Working remote becomes more and more important to many people. Remote: Office Not Required written by Jason Fried (co-founder of 37signals) and David Heinemeier Hansson (original creator of Ruby on Rails) is a great book dealing with this topic. It describes in detail the benefits and problems of building a software company having employees working from remote locations spread all over the world. This gives them great flexibility and enables to recruit talents without being tied to a specific location.</description>
