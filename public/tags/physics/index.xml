      <description>Another week has passed and as I promised last week, I am going to post interesting JavaFX Links here again. I specially want to thank Jonathan Giles, Richard Bair and Jasper Potts for their work in collecting the JavaFX Links of the week. Yet I cannot contribute much to the links of the week but hopefully in the future this will change.
Here are the JavaFX Links of the Week 2, February 2010:</description>

      <description>Today I decided to post regularly interesting JavaFX links of the past week. Thanks to Jonathan Giles for his great posts on &amp;#8220;Java Desktop Links of the Week&amp;#8221;. The JavaFX links are just taken from Jonathan&amp;#8217;s posts in order to build a little JavaFX news archieve on my own blog and to inform my subscribers on interesting JavaFX news.

      <description>At this years International Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH2009) a touchable holography was presented by the University of Tokio. It is a kind of holography that you are able to feel and interact with. Great development that you can see in the following video:

The first page of the presented scientific paper called &amp;#8220;Touchable Holography&amp;#8221; can be downloaded here.
