      <description>Dilbert&amp;#8217;s Salary Theorem states that: &amp;#8220;Engineers and scientists will never make as much money as business executives.&amp;#8220;
Now we have an mathematical proof that explains why this is true:
 Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power Postulate 2: Time is Money  As every engineer knows,
 Power = Work/Time
 Since Knowledge = Power we have:
 Knowledge = Work/Time.
 Since Time = Money we have:
 Knowledge = Work/Money.</description>

      <description>One of the highlights of October&amp;#8217;s Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco was the emergence of &amp;#8216;Semantic Apps&amp;#8217; as a force. Note that we&amp;#8217;re not necessarily talking about the Semantic Web, which is the Tim Berners-Lee W3C led initiative that touts technologies like RDF, OWL and other standards for metadata. Semantic Apps may use those technologies, but not necessarily [ReadWriteWeb 2007].  ReadWriteWeb has published a great list of 10 interesting semantic apps at the end of 2007.</description>
