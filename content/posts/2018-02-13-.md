Brendan Burns and David Oppenheimer, two Google engineers, wrote a good overview article on design patterns for container-based distributed systems. I really recommend reading this piece as it gives a good overview of emerging design patterns in distributed systems.

The world of design patterns is not new. A lot of software design patterns originate back to the early 1980s where object-oriented programming emerged and &#8220;the object&#8221; was the main abstraction.
  
These days the unit of abstraction are containers. <a href="https://content.pivotal.io/infographics/moments-in-container-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containers are not a new concept, they originate back to 1979</a>.

What are containers?

  * A container is just a collection of normal operating system processes
  * Running in isolation (process and resource isolation)
  * Exploit features in the OS kernel to provide lightweight virtualization &#8211; hypervisor not reqired
  * Enables efficient use of resources on host

A container can be managed as either as single unit on a single node or as multiple units on a single node.

## Single-container management patterns

## Single-node, multi-container application patterns

Sidecar pattern

Ambassador pattern

Adapter pattern

## Multi-node application patterns

Leader election pattern

Work queue pattern

Scatter/gather pattern (Fan In/Fan Out)
