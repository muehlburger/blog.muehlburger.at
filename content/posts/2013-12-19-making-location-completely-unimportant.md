Working remote becomes more and more important to many people. <a title="REMOTE office not required" href="http://37signals.com/remote/" target="_blank">Remote: Office Not Required</a> written by Jason Fried (co-founder of <a title="37signals.com" href="http://37signals.com/" target="_blank">37signals</a>) and <a title="David Heinemeier Hansson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson" target="_blank">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (original creator of <a title="Ruby on Rails" href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>) is a great book dealing with this topic. It describes in detail the benefits and problems of building a software company having employees working from remote locations spread all over the world. This gives them great flexibility and enables to recruit talents without being tied to a specific location.

> Technology is thus enabling arbitrary numbers of people from around the world to assemble in remote locations, without interrupting their ability to work or communicate with existing networks. In this sense, the future of technology is not really location-based apps; it is about making location completely unimportant. (via <a title="Software Is Reorganizing the World" href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/11/software-is-reorganizing-the-world-and-cloud-formations-could-lead-to-physical-nations/" target="_blank">Software Is Reorganizing the World by Balaji Srinivasan</a> and <a title="ma.tt" href="http://ma.tt/2013/12/reorganizing-the-world/" target="_blank">ma.tt</a>)

I like this notion of how technology creates new ways of working together finding solutions to real problems. I work remotely almost 100 percent of my time as a developer supporting our customers onsite. What about you? Do you work remotely as well?
