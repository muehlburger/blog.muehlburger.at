As a developer, there comes the time were you think about how to version your software. One approach is &#8220;<a title="Semantic Versioning" href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a>&#8221; which leverages the level of change on your public API. Depending on what you changed in your code, Semantic Versioning proposes different version numbers:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
>   1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
>   2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
>   3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
> 
> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Seems to be an appropriate scheme on versioning software. Which other schemes do you think about? Leave me a comment then I&#8217;m going to update this post accordingly.
