<a class="zem_slink" title="Adam Wilson (The Young and the Restless)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Wilson_%28The_Young_and_the_Restless%29">Adam Wilson</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Biomedical engineering" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering">biomedical engineering</a> doctoral student at [University of Wisconsin-Madison][1] has developed a brain to computer interface which makes it possible to directly write tweets through thoughts. <a title="ReadWriteWeb" href="www.readwriteweb.com" target="_blank">ReadWriteWeb</a> writes:

> Technically, what Wilson did was come up with an interface combining an Electroencephalogram, or <a class="zem_slink" title="Electroencephalography" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">brain wave</a> monitor, with an <a class="zem_slink" title="Virtual keyboard" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_keyboard">on screen keyboard</a> for selecting letters. The system lights up each key on the keyboard but is able to notice a difference in brain activity when the desired letter for input is lit. Wilson compares it to clicking through multiple letters when texting on a <a class="zem_slink" title="Mobile phone" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">mobile phone</a>.

> Once you&#8217;ve found a new way to input text &#8211; what are you going to do with it? Use it to <a class="zem_slink" title="Twitter" rel="homepage" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, of course!
> 
> Clearly, there&#8217;s some gimmickry going on in the news of Wilson&#8217;s interface. Who knows if this is better or worse than saying that a technology is developed to assist physically <a class="zem_slink" title="Disability" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability">disabled people</a> when it&#8217;s really going to be used by the military? Wilson does say that the technology will be helpful for people with active brains but immobile bodies. Now they&#8217;ll be able to Twitter, among other things, he says. Fair enough.

**[UPDATE] Here is a little video showing how the Brain Twitter Interface workes:**

Personally I think it is a great idea to use the currently hyped microblogging service for research activities.
