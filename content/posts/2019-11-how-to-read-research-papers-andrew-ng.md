Reading research papers can be hard and therefore I looked for strategies to optimize my paper readings. How should you read a research paper? How many papers should you read in order to understand a field broadly? There is a good talk on this topic from [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng), an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University.

## Here are my notes on how to read research papers:

- Read 5-20 papers to get a basic understanding of a field
- Read 50 - 100 papers and you have a very good understanding

## Steps to read understand a field

Andrew proposes the following three steps to understand a field better:

1. Compile a list of papers (research papers, blog posts, ...)
2. Skip around the list
3. Take mulitple passes through the papers

Make a list of 5 papers, read 10% of every paper and try to understand it. Try to find relevant other papers and update the list.

## Steps to read a paper

1. Read the Title, Abstract, Figures
2. Read Introduction, Conclusions, Figures, skip rest (skim related work)
3. Read the paper skip/skim the math
4. Read whole paper but skip things that don't make sense

## Ask the following questions while reading
- What do the authors try to accomplish?
- What are the key elements of the approach?
- What can you use yourself?
- What other references do your want to follow?

## Sources of papers
- Twitter
- Machine Learning Subreddit
- Conferences NIPS/ICML/ICLR
- Friends

My field of study is currently Intrusion Detectio (Cybersecurity) and Artificial Intelligence methods. You may think this is quite broad, and I agree. I try to narrow it down to a more specific topic. If you are interesting in my work just contact me and I'll be happy to share experiences.
