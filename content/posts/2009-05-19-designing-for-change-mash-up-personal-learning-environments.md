In order to describe what this article is about I cite Fridolin Wild, Felix Mödritscher and Stein E. Sigurdarson:

> In this article we first clarify key concepts and assumptions for personalised <a class="zem_slink" title="Learning" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning">learning</a> environments. Afterwards, we summarise our critique on the contemporary models for personalised adaptive learning. Subsequently, we propose our alternative, i.e. the concept of a mash-up personal learning environment that provides adaptation mechanisms for learning environment construction and maintenance. The <a class="zem_slink" title="Web application" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web application</a> mash-up solution allows learners to reuse existing (web-based) tools plus services.

The mash-up paradigm enables learners to integrate different information sources into their learning environmen. For example you could integrate youtube videos which explain your learning content in a visual way. Other integrations could be <a class="zem_slink" title="Wikipedia" rel="homepage" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> Links to related topics, or feeds of weblogs or <a class="zem_slink" title="Website" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a> which deal with the same topics.

Through mash-up personal learning environments (MUPPLE) the user is able to build up his <a class="zem_slink" title="Personalized learning" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_learning">personalized learning</a> envirionment fitting best the specific learning needs. MUPPLE suports the learning in achieving his learning goals.
