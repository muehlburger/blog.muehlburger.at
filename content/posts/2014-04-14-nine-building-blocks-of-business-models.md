In Alexander Osterwalder&#8217;s [business model generation canvas][1] every organization&#8217;s business model can be described using 9 building blocks:

## Customer Segments

This are all the people and organizations for which you are creating value. This includes simple users and paying customers.

## Value Proposition

This are products and services that create value for each of your customer segments.

## Channels

Channels describe through which touch points you are interacting with your customers and delivering value.

## Customer Relationships

Customer Relationships outline the type of relationship you establish with your customers.

## Revenue Streams

The Revenue Streams make clear how and through which pricing mechanisms your business model is capturing value.

## Key Resources

Key Resources describe the infrastructure through which you create, deliver, and capture value. The Key Resources show which assets are in dispense of your business model.

## Key Activities

Key Activities show which things you really need to perform well in order to succeed with your business model.

## Key Partnerships

Key Partnerships describe which partners could leverage your business model, since you won&#8217;t own all of your Key Resources and you won&#8217;t perform all of your Key Activities by yourself.

## Cost Structure

Having knowledge of your business model infrastructure helps you in describing your Cost Structure.

On YouTube you find the following video titled: &#8221; Alexander Osterwalder: The Business Model Canvas&#8221; which shows you the building blocks:
