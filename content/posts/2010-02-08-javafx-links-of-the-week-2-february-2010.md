Another week has passed and as I promised last week, I am going to post interesting <a class="zem_slink" title="JavaFX" rel="homepage" href="http://javafx.com/">JavaFX</a> Links here again. I specially want to thank **<a title="Jonathan Giles" href="http://jonathangiles.net/blog/" target="_blank">Jonathan Giles</a>**, **<a title="Richard Bair" href="http://www.java.net/blogs/rbair/" target="_blank">Richard Bair</a>** and **<a title="Jasper Potts" href="http://www.jasperpotts.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jasper Potts</a>** for their work in collecting the JavaFX Links of the week. Yet I cannot contribute much to the links of the week but hopefully in the future this will change.

Here are the **JavaFX Links of the Week 2, February 2010:**

>   * <a href="http://java.sun.com/javafx/1/reference/releasenotes/javafx-sdk-release-notes-1-2-3.html" target="_blank">JavaFX 1.2.3 was released this week</a>. It’s a maintenance release only (which means there are no new toys to play with). This release had a focus on improving performance, reliability, and download time. Various bugs have been fixed as well.
>   * Long time employee of Sun, and great advocate of both Swing and JavaFX, **Josh Marinacci**, has announced that he is moving on from Sun/Oracle, <a href="http://www.joshondesign.com/2010/02/03/leaving-sun-joining-palm/" target="_blank">taking up a position at Palm</a>.
>   * **Simon Morris** has posted an interesting tutorial on how to do <a href="http://www.jfxia.com/JFXTutorials/Tutorial1/" target="_blank">advanced clipping in JavaFX</a>. Clipping is something that becomes useful once you understand how to use it, so I recommend finding time to read this article.
>   * **Drew** from Piliq.com continues his exploration intophysics-based games. This week he posted progress in adding <a href="http://piliq.com/javafx/?p=1442" target="_blank">parallax scrolling and custom cursors</a>, and also an <a href="http://piliq.com/javafx/?p=1462" target="_blank">entirely new demo game</a>.
>   * Speaking of physics games, **Mikhail Gorshenev** has posted a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/mgorshenev/entry/broken_tetris" target="_blank">fun version of Tetris that spices up the original game</a> by requiring you to simply have two or more blocks of the same colour touch. The kicker? The blocks now exhibit physical properties and fall accordingly.
>   * **Alex Ruiz** has posted a new release of his <a href="http://alexruiz.developerblogs.com/?p=938" target="_blank">FEST JavaFX Maven plugin</a>, bumping the version to 1.0 alpha 1. This is a Maven plugin for compiling JavaFX source files.
>   * **Vyacheslav Baranov** writes about the availability (or not, depending on which OS your software is running on) of <a href="http://javafx.com/docs/techtips/rtsp/" target="_blank">Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) support in JavaFX 1.2</a>.
>   * **Rakesh Menon** has posted sample code to illustrate <a href="http://rakeshmenonp.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/javafx-upload-file/" target="_blank">how to upload files using JavaFX</a>.
>   * **Kon** at Outrospective.org has posted an overview of the <a href="http://outrospective.org/wordpress/?p=281" target="_blank">JavaFX 1.2 charting features</a>.

I specially recommend to have a look at the <a title="JavaFX Tetris Port" href="http://blogs.sun.com/mgorshenev/entry/broken_tetris" target="_blank">Tetris Game</a> developed by <a title="Mikhail Gorshenev" href="http://blogs.sun.com/mgorshenev/" target="_blank">Mikhail Gorshenev</a> I think it is great! So have fun and enjoy coding JavaFX.
