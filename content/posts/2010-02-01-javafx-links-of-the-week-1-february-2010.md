Today I decided to post regularly interesting JavaFX links of the past week. Thanks to <a title="Jonathan Gile's Blog" href="http://jonathangiles.net/blog/" target="_blank">Jonathan Giles</a> for his great posts on &#8220;Java Desktop Links of the Week&#8221;. The JavaFX links are just taken from Jonathan&#8217;s posts in order to build a little JavaFX news archieve on my own blog and to inform my subscribers on interesting JavaFX news.

Here are the **JavaFX Links of the Week 1, February 2010:**

>   * **Jim Weaver** sums up the Oracle news this week nice and succinctly: ‘[We will invest heavily in JavaFX][1]‘.
>   * The JavaFX tutorial has been updated to include a [gentler introduction to data binding and triggers][2], with a new chapter devoted exclusively to “the basics”. Also, apparently there are plans to include a more advanced article discussing this topic also.
>   * Want tabs in your JavaFX application? Well, today’s your lucky day as **toumaille** has posted exactly this. His [tabbed pane control][3] appears to be well thought out, and may be of use to people out there, certainly until there is an official tab control in JavaFX.
>   * **Drew**, carrying on his investigation into JavaFX and physics, has put up a JavaFX applet of a very, very simple [platform game using real physics][4].
>   * **Exadel** released a new version of their JavaFX Plug-In for Eclipse, [taking it up to version 1.2.1][5].
>   * **Jim Weaver** introduces an [interesting visualisation][6] developed in JavaFX by **Nik Silver.** You can [go directly to the visualisation][7] if you are interested in playing with it.
>   * **Simon Morris** has put up a page that contains [all of the demos][8] he wrote whilst writing his book ‘JavaFX in Action’.
>   * **Pedro Duque Vieira** has written about how he has [embedded a JavaFX scene into a Swing application][9].
>   * **Krishna Kishore** has created a JavaFX application that [grows/animates flowers onto the screen][10]. It’s a rather nice effect, and shows the power of the language given Krishna admits creating this program just to learn the language.
