In order to prepare and pass the <a href="http://certification.salesforce.com/app-builders" target="_blank">Salesforce App Builder Exam</a> I follow the learning path as described in the official &#8220;<a href="http://certification.salesforce.com/SG_CertifiedPlatformAppBuilder.pdf" target="_blank">Certified Salesforce Platform App Builder Study Guide</a>&#8220;.

But how many questions on each topic have to be answered in the exam? The total number of questions is 60 and the expected number of questions on each topic can easily be calculated:

My strategy is to begin with the most important topic with the most questions and work my way down to the end of the list.

This post is the beginning of a series of posts on how I prepared for the exam. This part gave an overview of the topics and their weights. In the next part of I will focus on &#8220;**Business Logic and Process Automation**&#8221; in Salesforce and go into more depth.

Stay tuned and stay focused!
