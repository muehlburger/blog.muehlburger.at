Tomorrow I will write the first mathematical analyis exam for this term. By now I solved all the exercise sheets and I think that I am well prepared. Need to pass this lecture this year since it is the last term of my undergraduate studies. Professor Grabner presented us this video about the mathematical analyis:



What do you think about this video? I think it&#8217;s weird. Well wish me luck for tomorrow. For further Information check out the website of the lecture &#8220;<a title="Analysis T1" href="http://www.math.tugraz.at/~grabner/AnalysisT1/" target="_blank">Analysis T1</a>&#8220;
