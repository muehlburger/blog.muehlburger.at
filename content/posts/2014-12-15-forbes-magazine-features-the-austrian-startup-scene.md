<a title="http://www.forbes.com" href="http://www.forbes.com" target="_blank">Forbes</a> is one of the top magazines on business related topics. It published an interesting article called &#8220;<a title="Scaling Alpine Heights: Austria's Startup Scene" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2014/12/10/austrias-start-up-scene-scaling-alpine-heights/" target="_blank">Scaling Alpine Heights: Austria&#8217;s Startup Scene</a>&#8220;on the Austrian Startup Scene. The following statement attracted my attention:

> &#8220;The country is enjoying something of an entrepreneurial renaissance, driven largely by the return of some highly successful founders whose presence has awoken its capital Vienna from a start-up winter sleep.&#8221; [by Forbes]

The Austrian startups that made it to the article are the following ones (details on the startups can be found in the article and on their corresponding website):

Although Austria offers quite some support for starting a business (e.g. by granting loans, issuing bank guarantees and R&D grants, availability of cloud services such as AWS and Google App Engine) it is still not as startup friendly as it should be. High labour costs, high payroll-taxes and high health insurance costs not to forget the lack of real tax incentives for startups and startup investors to give some examples.

Florian Dorfbauer, CEO and co-founder of Austrian website feedback startup <a title="usersnap" href="https://usersnap.com/" target="_blank">Usersnap</a> states:

> “I expect that Vienna will be the number one start-up hub of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) – other CEE capitals like Budapest or Bratislava are within a few hours’ travel time – and I expect the dogma ‘Move to Silicon Valley or Die’ to shift towards ‘move some people to Silicon Valley and keep the core-team in Austria’, as there is little reason to expose an early- to mid stage start-up to Silicon Valley cost structures.
> 
> “And of course I expect a string of successes from my fellow start-up colleagues, so yes, I am feeling very optimistic about Vienna.”

If this is the future of Austrian Startup Scene then I&#8217;m looking forward to it. What do you think about the Austrian Startup Scene? Leave me a comment or drop me a note on <a title="@hmuehlburger" href="http://twitter.com/hmuehlburger" target="_blank">@hmuehlburger</a>.
