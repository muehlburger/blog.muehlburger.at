JSON Web Token (JWT) is a IETF standard defined in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519" target="_blank">rfc7519.</a>

> JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

&nbsp;

> &#8220;It can also carry all the user’s claim, such as authorization data, so the service provider does not need to go into the database or external systems to verify user roles and permissions for each request; that data is extracted from the token.&#8221;
