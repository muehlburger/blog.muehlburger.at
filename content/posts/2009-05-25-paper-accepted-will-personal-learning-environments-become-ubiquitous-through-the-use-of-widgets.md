Few time ago we got the review on our paper submitted to the <a title="I-KNOW '09" href="http://i-know.tugraz.at/" target="_blank">9th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies (I-KNOW &#8217;09)</a>. The paper is titled **&#8220;Will Personal Learning Environments become ubiquitous <a title="I-KNOW '09" href="http://i-know.tugraz.at/" target="_blank"></a>through the use of Widgets?&#8221;** and was accepted as follows:

> We are pleased to inform you that your paper
  
> Title: Will Personal Learning Environments become ubiquitous through the use of Widgets?
  
> has been accepted for publication as short paper (max. 6 pages) in the conference proceedings on condition of integrating the recommendations of the reviewers.

The conference is located in <a class="zem_slink" title="Graz" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=47.0702777778,15.4388888889&spn=1.0,1.0&q=47.0702777778,15.4388888889%20%28Graz%29&t=h">Graz</a> (<a class="zem_slink" title="Austria" rel="geolocation" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=48.2,16.35&spn=10.0,10.0&q=48.2,16.35%20%28Austria%29&t=h">Austria</a>) from the 2nd &#8211; 4th of September 2009. By the way, it is my first publication which I very happy about! For everybody who is interested in the field of Knowledge Management and Knowledge Technologies should register for the conference as <a title="registration" href="http://i-know.tugraz.at/registration" target="_blank">registration</a> has just been opened.
