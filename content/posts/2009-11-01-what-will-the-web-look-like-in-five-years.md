<a title="Eric Schmidt" href="http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#eric" target="_blank">Eric Schmidt</a>, CEO of Google was answering this question in an interesting interview at <a title="Gartner Symposium/ITxpo Orlando 2009" href="http://blogs.gartner.com/symposium-times/" target="_blank">Gartner Symposium/ITxpo Orlando 2009</a>. <a title="ReadWriteWeb" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com" target="_blank">ReadWriteWeb</a> has summarized the <a title="ReadWriteWeb" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_web_in_five_years.php" target="_blank">highlights</a> of Eric&#8217;s interview as follows:

>   * Five years from now the internet will be dominated by <a class="zem_slink" title="Chinese language" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese-language</a> content.
>   * Today&#8217;s teenagers are the model of how the web will work in five years &#8211; they jump from app to app to app seamlessly.
>   * Five years is a factor of ten in [Moore&#8217;s Law][1], meaning that computers will be capable of far more by that time than they are today.
>   * Within five years there will be broadband well above 100MB in performance &#8211; and distribution distinctions between TV, radio and the web will go away.
>   * &#8220;We&#8217;re starting to make significant money off of Youtube&#8221;, content will move towards more video.
>   * &#8220;Real time information is just as valuable as all the other information, we want it included in our search results.&#8221;
>   * There are many companies beyond Twitter and Facebook doing real time.
>   * &#8220;We can index real-time info now &#8211; but how do we rank it?&#8221;
>   * It&#8217;s because of this fundamental shift towards user-generated information that people will listen more to other people than to traditional sources. Learning how to rank that &#8220;is the great challenge of the age.&#8221; Schmidt believes Google can solve that problem.

Chinese-language content, no differences between distribution channels and real time information are some very interesting topics which I really have to dive in. If you feel interested then have a look at the video of the interview:
