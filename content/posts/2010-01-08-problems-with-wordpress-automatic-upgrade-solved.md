While trying to upgrade my <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> installation from version 2.9 to version 2.9.1 I always got the following error:

> _Downloading update from http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.9.1.zip._
  
> Download failed.: Operation timed out with 1201840 out of -1 bytes received
  
> Installation Failed

After doing some research using <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google </a>I found a solution to that problem:

You just need to edit the following file in order to increase the download timeout:

<pre class="brush: php">/wp-admin/includes/file.php</pre>

Near line 461 of file.php change the timeout value from:

<pre class="brush: php">$response = wp_remote_get($url, array('timeout' =&gt; 60));</pre>

to the new value of 120:

<pre class="brush: php">$response = wp_remote_get($url, array('timeout' =&gt; 120));</pre>

Then try again to upgrade your wordpress installation using the automatic upgrade and it should work properly now. Mine did and I am happy again! ðŸ™‚

Cheers and have fun, and leave me a comment if this post was useful for you!
