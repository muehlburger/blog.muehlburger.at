Recently I have read about <a title="Fiverr" href="http://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank">Fiverr</a>, a service which enables users to offer or buy micro-services for $5 Dollars.

Here are some sample offers:

>   * I will write and record you a song for $5
>   * I will help you with Spanish homework for $5
>   * I will do your maths and programming homework for $5
>   * <a title="I will send you a postcard from Austria for $5" href="http://www.fiverr.com/users/muehlburger/gigs/send-you-a-postcard-from-austria" target="_blank">I will send you a postcard from Austria for $5</a>

That&#8217;s a great idea! ðŸ™‚
