I have just added a new site to my this weblog called &#8220;<a title="Web Science Reading List" href="http://blog.muehlburger.at/web-science-reading-list/" target="_self">Web Science Reading List</a>&#8220;. This reading list collects a lot of interesting information on web science and similar topics. Since I do not have time to read all of the articles immediately I am going to collect them on this site and bookmark them on [delicious][1] too. If you are interested in this topic as well do not hesitate to contact me or to subscribe to my delicious bookmarks and to the <a title="Feed" href="http://blog.muehlburger.at/feed/" target="_blank">feed</a> of this weblog.
