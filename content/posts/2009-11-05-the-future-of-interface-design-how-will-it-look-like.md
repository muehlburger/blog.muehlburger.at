<a title="Posts by David  Leggett" href="http://www.uxbooth.com/author/admin/" target="_blank">David Leggett</a> tried to answer this question in a <a title="The Future of Interface Design" href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/the-future-of-interface-design/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> written for <a title="uxbooth" href="http://www.uxbooth.com/" target="_blank">uxBOOTH</a>. He writes:

> The future of how we interact with computers is exciting to say the least. What once seemed like nonsense outside of Hollywood and <a class="zem_slink" title="Science fiction" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">Science Fiction</a> is now starting to find it’s way into reality, and some of the technology is a bit overwhelming. Have a taste of what the future of <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface design" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design">interface design</a> has to offer:

Here are some of the most interesting videos from the post as well as some additional ones i have found:

## Head Up Displays for Consumer Vehicles

The following video is showing an Apple iPhone App using the concept of Heas Up Displays. Working not so bad actually.



Originally Head Up Displays were developed for military use:



## Gesture Based Interfaces

Applications like the following are geture based and increasingly becoming populous.

Another very interesting type of gesture based interfaces are multitouch screens like seen in the following video:



## Spatial Motion Interfaces

In Spatial Motion Interfaces the user becomes the controller and can controll the <a class="zem_slink" title="Application software" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">application</a> through movements the user is performing. Check out the following video for a demonstration. Lookes really interesting.



## <a class="zem_slink" title="Augmented reality" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented Reality</a>

Augmented Reality is brings <a class="zem_slink" title="Virtual reality" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a> and the real work together and makes it possible to build great applications. As <a class="zem_slink" title="Mobile device" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device">mobile devices</a> increase in computing power this applications are becoming more and more popular:

## Other sensor Based Interfaces

Other sensor Based Interfaces are Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) enabling to communicate with an application through just thinking of specific commands:



#### B2B &#8211; BrainToBrain: A BCI Experiment



#### Mind Control Device Demonstration &#8211; Tan Le



## Smart Surfaces

Smart Surfaces are becoming more and more popular too. Here is a video showing this concept:



Feel free to add some interesting videos which you have found on the web. I am happy if you post them in the comments.
