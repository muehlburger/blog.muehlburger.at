<span class="byline-author">Brandon Falls from Google </span><span class="byline-author">Search Quality Team, wrote </span><span class="byline-author">on the <a title="Google's SEO Starter Guide" href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/11/googles-seo-starter-guide.html" target="_blank">Official Google Webmaster Central Blog</a> the following lines:</span>

> Webmasters often ask us at conferences or in the [Webmaster Help Group][1], &#8220;What are some simple ways that I can improve my website&#8217;s performance in Google?&#8221; There are lots of possible answers to this question, and a wealth of search engine optimization information on the web, so much that it can be intimidating for newer webmasters or those unfamiliar with the topic. We thought it&#8217;d be useful to create a compact guide that lists some best practices that teams within Google and external webmasters alike can follow that could improve their sites&#8217; crawlability and indexing.

What he and his group did was to create a compact guide called the &#8220;<a title="Google's SEO Starter Guide" href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf" target="_blank">Google SEO Starter Guide</a>&#8220;. There are lot&#8217;s of DOs and DON&#8217;Ts published. Every blogger and every website owner should have a look on this paper.

> We felt that these areas (like improving title and description meta tags, URL structure, site navigation, content creation, anchor text, and more) would apply to webmasters of all experience levels and sites of all sizes and types.

<span class="byline-author">Is Google trying to put SEOs out of business in order to improve indexing sites? This guide will help a lot of people who haven&#8217;t done anything related to SEO. Advanced users won&#8217;t profit much from Google&#8217;s SEO Starter Guide.</span>

<a title="TheNextWeb" href="http://thenextweb.com/2008/11/13/google-publishes-a-best-practice-guide/" target="_blank">TheNextWeb</a> is supprised about Google&#8217;s step:

> In a slightly surprising move, Google has launched via its <a title="Google SEO Guide" rel="nofollow" href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/11/googles-seo-starter-guide.html" target="_blank">webmaster central blog</a> a <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf" target="_blank">best practice guide</a> for search engine optimization.  Why surprising you may ask? Well, Google is notorious for being pretty quiet on this front leaving it to SEO’s, designers, and developers to figure out what works best.

<a title="Netzlogbuch" href="http://netzlogbuch.de/google/google-seo-starter-guide/" target="_blank">Netzlogbuch</a> states out that the start guide copes basic things that nearly everybody already knows. Well for sure it is helpful for many people out there.
