In times of <a title="PRISM" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)" target="_blank">PRISM</a> I decided to delete my Facebook account, a second time. My main reasons are the following:

## I want to be in control of my data

  1. I want to be in control of the data that I share.
  2. I am concerned about my privacy and therefore I do want to be in control of my data (or at least in as much control as possible)
  3. I do not want to have anybody else making aggregations and connections concerning my profiles apart the ones that I explicitly create.
  4. I do not agree that Facebook claims that everything I post/like/share on this social media platform has anything to do with my real life. Actually I am aware of my posts and likes and I was always posting keeping in mind that potentially everybody has access to this content. Facebook Timeline does not reflect my life in any sense. In order to prevent others from thinking so I at least have to be controlling all the activity going on on my timeline or delete my entire account. The latter was the better option for me.
  5. Second I am a computer scientist who has some knowledge on machine learning, social media analytics and user profiling techniques and knows how to apply them. So I do know what you can do with data on Facebook and I don&#8217;t want to be subject of such action.

## <span style="font-size: 1.285714286rem; line-height: 1.6;">I want to focus on more important things</span>

  1. I want to spend my time in a more productive manner rather than keeping track and correcting updates on facebook (probably made by others)
  2. I do not want to use Facebook just as a tool of promoting myself (there are other social media platforms which better suite this use case such as linkedin or xing)
  3. I want to spend more time maintaining my blog and less time feeding social networks with the latest gossip news
  4. I am not a Social Media Expert
  5. I do not want to read only filtered information that Facebook thinks is important to me (well I am aware that Google does the same but at least there is some kind of excape to search for information on other sources
  6. &#8230;

These are some of my reasons for deleting my Facebook account. What do you think about this?
