**Dilbert&#8217;s Salary Theorem** states that: &#8220;_Engineers and scientists will never make as much money as business executives._&#8220;

Now we have an mathematical proof that explains why this is true:

  * Postulate 1: Knowledge is Power
  * Postulate 2: Time is Money

As every engineer knows,

> Power = Work/Time

Since Knowledge = Power we have:

> Knowledge = Work/Time.

Since Time = Money we have:

> Knowledge = Work/Money.

Solving for Money we get:

> **Money = Work/Knowledge** 

Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity regardless of the Work done.

**Conclusion:  __**_The less you know, the more you Money you make._
